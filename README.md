Zenburn for MATLAB
==================

A port of the [Zenburn](http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/) color
scheme to the MATLAB environment.

Installation
------------

Simply run the `zenburn_matlab.m` script. It will programatically
change the Colors settings in the MATLAB preferences. The file may be
deleted after the colors have been changed; changes should persist
across MATLAB invocations.
